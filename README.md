# Process objective – most important objectives

• Quality - ensure documentation is technically accurate and up-to-date. Minimize gaps, inconsistencies and redundancies in documentation. Ensure documentation meets compliance standards,

• Efficiency - integrate activities with the development lifecycle. Automate documentation generation,

• Accessibility - Ensure documentation is easy to search and find. Track documentation updates and approvals through version control and change logs,

• Others - Implement regular documentation review cycles.

# Process scope

The purpose of this process is to standardize the creation, review, approval and maintenance of software documentation to ensure objectives, i.e. quality, efficiency and accessibility. It starts with   the checklist completed by the Software Developer and it ends with the approval of the new documentation release delivered by the Reviewer. The process doesn’t define supported documentation types, checklists content for participants, documentation schemas, documentation development guides and their content. The automated documentation delivery and deployment activities are also excluded.

# Control points (KPI) - examples

• Documentation Coverage  - % of user stories with linked docs,

• Number of defects in documentation, e.g. gaps, technical defects,

• Documentation NPS (Net Promoter Score).
